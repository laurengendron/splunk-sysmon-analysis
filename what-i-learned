Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with ingesting, parsing, and analyzing Sysmon event logs in Splunk Cloud. Key lessons include:

Log ingestion and indexing

Uploading CSV data into Splunk Cloud and assigning the correct sourcetype and index.

Understanding how Splunk processes and stores events for analysis.

SPL (Search Processing Language) skills

Writing queries to filter, sort, and summarize events.

Creating tables and statistics to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

Field extraction and event parsing

Mapping CSV columns to searchable fields.

Using automatic and manual field extraction to make network and process data actionable.

Troubleshooting workflow

Handling common issues like inactive indexes, license restrictions, and data formatting problems.

Understanding the relationship between sourcetype, index, and searchable events.

Portfolio and documentation skills

Documenting a Splunk project for clarity and reproducibility.

Organizing queries, screenshots, and datasets in a professional GitHub repository.

This project strengthened my skills in SIEM, log analysis, and cybersecurity monitoring, preparing me for real-world use cases in IT security operations.
